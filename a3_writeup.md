# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
Search_pa_list function is searching through the pa_list that has the phrases and actions that the chatbot can understand and then matches the word phrase/source to the pattern that was defined in the pa_list.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added Iron Man, which was made in 2008 and I added it because it was the movie that partially got me interested in engineering and creating electronics for the betterment of society.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
I added the, "who made" pattern and the action was director by title. This pattern / action is not necessarily useful if I am being honest since it is redudant since that relative pattern already exists but is just worded differently.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
The chatbot that I would create would be related to NBA statistics that would provide the most amount of points/stats, the most awards received by a player, or when a player retired.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
The most difficult portion was the search pa list function since I did not know how to access the data from the action since I already knew to iterate through pa list and what the function needed to do, I just did not know how to do it in the python way.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
Yes.
